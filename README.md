# What this:
This is a first draft of some NFT standards across the Ethereum and NEAR ecosystems.

On behalf of Mintbase, I have drafted several Ethereum NFT-related standards
into Rust, and documented the Mintbase Store Contract API, to compare notes with
other application builders in the NEAR ecosystem. It is my understanding that
NEAR will wither and die, and we along with it, if we fail to build a ecosystem
of interoperable contracts that engages our users, building on one the work of
one another.

The NEP4 standard is a start, but leaves significant room for improvement.

# Goals:
1. Create standards for Marketplace-type and NFT-minter-type contracts on NEAR
   that will allow our projects to interoperate
2. Unite the NEAR-NFT ecosystem around a shared ethos of community building and
   interoperability
